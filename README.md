# 🖥️ Interactive Navigation Menu with Smooth Scroll

This project features an **Interactive Navigation Menu** with a smooth scroll effect, designed to enhance the user experience when navigating a single-page website. The navigation bar remains fixed at the top of the screen and changes color dynamically when the user scrolls. The menu links scroll smoothly to the respective sections of the page.

## 🚀 Features

- **Fixed Navigation Bar**: Stays at the top of the page as users scroll.
- **Interactive Hover Effects**: Links change color and display hover effects to provide visual feedback.
- **Dynamic Background Change**: The navigation bar changes its background color and shadow when scrolling.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Smoothly scrolls to the relevant section when a menu link is clicked.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring usability across devices.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the structure of the web page.
- **CSS3**: For styling, hover effects, and layout design.
- **JavaScript**: For smooth scrolling and dynamic background changes on scroll.
  
## 🎨 Design Highlights

- **Gradient Navigation Bar**: The navigation bar has a sleek gradient background that dynamically changes upon scrolling.
- **Responsive Layout**: Fully responsive design that works seamlessly across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Hover Effects**: Interactive hover effects on the navigation links to improve user experience.

## 📂 Folder Structure

```bash
interactive-navigation-menu/
│
├── index.html         # Main HTML file containing the layout
├── styles.css         # CSS file for styling
└── script.js          # JavaScript file for interactive functionality
```

## 🔧 Setup and Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GAURIPATIL-2004/PRODOGY_WD_01/Task1.git
   ```
2. **Navigate into the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd PRODOGY_WD_01/Task1
   ```
3. **Open `index.html`**:
   Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the navigation menu in action.


## 📋 How It Works

- **Scrolling Effect**: The `script.js` file adds a scrolling event listener to change the navbar's background color when scrolling past 50px.
- **Smooth Scroll**: On clicking a navigation link, JavaScript smoothly scrolls the page to the corresponding section.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts automatically for different screen sizes, providing an optimized experience on mobile devices.
